How to enable bluetooth in parrot linux
---------------------------------------------------------
To block the device in tlp, do the following

Get the id of the bluetooth device from lsusb command

shubham@mint ~ $ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 064e:930b Suyin Corp. 
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0438:7900 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:b006 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. 
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0438:7900 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Here, 0bda:b006, 064e:930b etc are ids.

Let's say, 0bda:b006 is the offending device. Now open the tlp configuration file at /etc/default/tlp. I prefer nano editor, so use command sudo nano /etc/default/tlp

Find the line that reads

#USB_BLACKLIST="1111:2222 3333:4444"
change it to

USB_BLACKLIST="0bda:b006"
change device id to the offending device id. Remove the#

Reboot

// I have tested it in linux mint and this works. No need to use the method below.

I ran into this problem today after installing Linux Mint only to find out that I had to setup some stuff to get bluetooth working correctly. You can find the package that will allow you to connect to bluetooth devices here. After installing it and connecting successfully to my speaker however I got the weirdest error:

Result: Connection Failed: Stream Setup Failed

After searching around the internet I found how to fix it.

1. Ensure pulse audio is installed with

sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth

2. If itâ€™s still not working run the command

pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover

After running that command I was able to connect just fine with my tower stereo. Add this command to your startup and you should be good to go!
